## What is it?

This is going to be a  tool that combines the best of several different
productivity methodologies.

- It will help keep the Pomodoro Technique rhythm of 4 25 minute work periods
  with five minute breaks, followed by a long 15 minute break.
- It will record what you are doing throughout the day by prompting the user to
  answer questions throughout the day.
- It will store a backlog of todo items, organized with GTD @context and
  +project tags.
